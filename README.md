# P1_GuessingGame
 Number Guessing Game


"""
Instructions:
As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message.
A random number should be chosen that is within the range.
As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.
When the game ends, an ending message is shown to the player.
"""

"""
Exceeds Expectations:
  When the player chooses to play the game again, a new random number within the range is chosen each time.
  The player cannot enter a number that is outside the number range. If the player tries they are informed that number was not a valid option and to try again.
  Display a high score (number of least guesses) at the start of a new game so the player knows the goal they are trying to beat.
  Instead of just ending the game each time, ask the user if they would like to play again.
  If yes, then cycle the user back into guessing a number again.
  If no, then provide the user with an ending/quit/goodbye message.
